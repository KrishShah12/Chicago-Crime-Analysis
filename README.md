# Chicago-Crime-Analysis

The primary goal of the analysis is to develop a model that can predict the number and types of crimes that may occur on a single day based on time series and location data
The project will feature regression analysis on a large dataset of crimes in the city of
Chicago, Illinois filtered from January 1st, 2018 to the present day. The dataset is sourced
directly from the cityâ€™s official Open Data Portal. Alongside the creation and optimization of a
regression model, the project will feature geographical analysis, hypothesis testing, and
additional historical context. The primary goal of the analysis is to develop a model that can
predict the number and types of crimes that may occur on a single day based on time series
and location data. 
Analyzing variations in crime rates across different times of the day, days of
the week, or even seasonal patterns can contribute to a nuanced understanding of when
specific types of crimes are more likely to occur. Additionally, investigating any notable spikes or
declines in crime frequencies during significant events, public holidays, or local festivities can
provide context to the temporal dynamics of criminal activities.



Data source:
The data will be filtered to include only those crimes occurring on a predefined time frame
( Jan 2018 - Jan 2023). Important attributes of the database include: Date, Time, Crime type,
Description of crime, Block Address, Ward, District, Location type, Arrest, Domestic.
